# Edmund-And-Eliza

Edmund and Eliza is a medieval themed, horror-centric, story-focused, action adventure game with a focus on combat, exploration, and puzzle solving. Developed with Unreal Engine 5 using C++ and Blueprints. Character assets modeled in Blender, environment assets are from Quixel Bridge and Unreal Engine marketplace.

Edmund and Eliza is a senior design capstone project for California State University of Northridge.

The story of Edmund and Eliza is about a knight named Edmund Dantes who ventures into a mysterious village in search of a merchant's missing daughter named Eliza Bonteri. The game features two playable protagonists, Edmund and Eliza. Edmund's section of the game focuses on his exploration of the village in search of a way into the castle, where he believes Eliza is being held captive. Eliza's section of the game focuses on her searching for a way to escape the castle so she can reunite with her father. 

The gameplay of Edmund and Eliza is similar to that of Dark Souls and Resident Evil. The game is a short experience, about one to two hours long. The combat is fun and thrilling, yet deliberate and attentive, and punishes the player for poor positioning and timing. The game also has large levels the player can explore, with lots of things to do. The player has an inventory where they can store items, such as keys for unlocking doors and drinks that restore their health. 

The art style and graphics of Edmund and Eliza is reminiscent of the Play Station 2 era of video games. Edmund and Eliza is meant to harken back to that time period and remind players of their childhood.

Enjoy Edmund and Eliza!
